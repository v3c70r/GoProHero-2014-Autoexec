#NightLapse for the HERO 2014

Yes, thats right. Take those long exposure pictures with your GoPro HERO 2014 ($129).

###How to:

First, download the file by right clicking on the RAW button of the autoexec.ash page (above, click autoexec.ash!), select "SAVE AS" and choose the SD card as a destination folder, the place where DCIM and MISC are. Then open the file with a text editor and change:

* **P** with the ISO value
* **X** with the [exp value](http://chernowii.com/gopro-longexp), there is a table with exp values.
* **Y** with the same value as X
* **A** with the interval, but choose something more than the exposure time + 3 seconds, so if I choose 5 seconds exp, I choose 10 seconds interval (5+3+2).

And then save, aim at the milky way, turn on and Be a HERO.
