#NightPhoto for the HERO 2014 (Currently Broken)

Yes, thats right. Take those long exposure photos with your GoPro HERO 2014 ($129).

###How to:

First, download the file by right clicking on the RAW button of the autoexec.ash page (above, click autoexec.ash!), select "SAVE AS" and choose the SD card as a destination folder, the place where DCIM and MISC are. Then open the file with a text editor and change:

* **P** with the ISO value
* **X** with the [exp value](http://chernowii.com/gopro-longexp), there is a table with exp values.
* **Y** with the same value as X

And then save, aim at the milky way, turn on and Be a HERO. It should take a picture, wait some time and turn off the camera.
