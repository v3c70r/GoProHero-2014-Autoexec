#TimeLapse for the HERO 2014

The GoPro HERO 2014 (129$) only takes pictures at 0.5 seconds? What a shame. Use this hack to bypass that limit and make a nice 3 hours timelapse.

###How to:

First, choose a interval, click the folder with the appropiate interval. Click autoexec.ash, download the file by right clicking on the RAW button of the autoexec.ash page, select "SAVE AS" and choose the SD card as a destination folder, the place where DCIM and MISC are.
And then save, aim at the sky, and turn on, it should start making timelapse.
